## My role

My role in the project was to take an existing application from any realm possible (desktop, tablet, mobile, coffee machine…) and redesign it using the emotional design principles. As the application, I chose something I use every week, if not every day: [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/). I then created wireflows and an emotional map of the application and made it more emotional.

## The challenge


#### Interaction map & emotional analysis
The first challenge was to create an interaction map and analyse the main emotions for the application. To do this, I applied the knowledge from the emotion wheel:

With the help of this wheel, I found out that the main emotions evoked during interacting with the application are:

* Curiousness
* Relief
* Liberation
* Anxiety
* Confusion
* Annoyance
* Frustration

#### How might we improve the experience?

After the interaction map, my coursemates from EKA and I started ideating on our initial "How might we…?" questions. With some help from ChatGPT, my question stood as follows:

> How might we create a more engaging and emotionally satisfying experience for users when they enter their expenses on Splitwise, so that it feels less like a chore and more like a fun and rewarding activity?

The design principles that I set for myself during the ideation & design process were these:

* Reward!
* Simplify!
* Surprise!
* Empower!

From the ideation, I got a lot of great ideas (and hopefully gave my coursemates ideas on their projects as well) and got to work.

## Solution

The solution was to create something witty, colorful and introduce a bit of urgency into the application.

Urgency came into play, because based on the feedback that I received, nobody ever wants to ask other people for their money back. It feels like an anxious and frustrating journey to ask people for money.

A sense of urgency was created by the slightly tinted backgrounds in the application – if you're in trouble (in the sense that you owe someone money), the tint is more red. If you're in for a treat (as in someone owes you money), the background is greener.

From the top dropdown, you can choose a group. From the plus, you can add a new group.

**Everything is on the first screen.**

## Results

I learned how to use the color wheel to describe the deepest darkest emotions. I also learned Norman's three levels of design, which I adore very much and always keep in mind in next iterations:

* The visceral (aka the visual) level
* The behavioral (aka the interactive) level
* The reflective (aka the yet-to-come) level
