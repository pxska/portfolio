## My role

My role in the project was to understand the way of interaction designers. The course surrounding the project, "Introduction to Interaction Design", was the first contact I had with interaction design. I teamed up with two of my coursemates, Sofia and Esther, with whom we came up with **Ph√µ√µn**.

## The challenge

The challenge consisted of three words: "Boost Tallinner's health". We went through a very rigid (but interesting and enlightening) structure of how to design an interaction and a story around it. We went through the design process, including (but not limited to):
* User research
* Ideation & Rapid Prototyping
* Concept development
* Video storytelling

The deliverables for this project were a design concept & a presentation.

#### Teaming up

As said before, I teamed up with two of my coursemates, Sofia and Esther. It was the first time I was in a team setting at school, studying Interaction Design, and I have to admit, it felt a bit awkward at first. However, our mentor Nesli very quickly directed us (and all other teams) into making a team canvas. We named our team **Koduk√§ijad**, simply because it was a cool Estonian word meaning basically a person haunting a home for something bad they did.

#### Defining & understanding the problem

We then went through the process of actually defining the problem for ourselves. We needed to understand, what the phrase "boosting Tallinner's health" actually means. Here's some points we came up with:

**Boost**
* Boosting can from an initial level (from 0 ‚Üí 10)
* Boosting can also happen from an already ‚Äúmotivated‚Äù point (from 5 ‚Üí 10)
* "Boost" is a juice company in Estonia üòâ
* Boosting = motivating, encouraging, improving
* Discipline needed for boosting

**Tallinner's**
* People who live in Tallinn
* Residing/ going to reside in Tallinn for more than 3 months?
* (maybe also people who are visiting Tallinn?)
* (people who are initially from Tallinn, but perhaps have moved away from the city?)
* Are the people who we randomly meet on the street definitely Tallinners? Should we ask them if they‚Äôre from Tallinn if we are interviewing them?

**Health**
The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) offers a simple definition of health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"

#### Interviewing

Yikes. Letting an Estonian go interview random people on the street is like sending a person to hell‚Ä¶ but I got through it somehow. We conducted 5 semi-structured interviews (mostly just asking people what they think health is) and got a lot of insight into solving the problem. Here are some very influential quotes we received:

> "My mother didn‚Äôt support me going to the psychologist ‚Äì she said that it would affect my ability to get a job‚Ä¶"
> "Discussing mental health issues shouldn‚Äôt be taboo!"
> "People are scared to talk about mental health issues."
> "Some topics are quite sensitive and I am not able to open up easily‚Ä¶"
> "People should be open to talking about their difficulties more often & they should find a trustworthy contact or seek professional help."
> "Don‚Äôt carry the burden alone. It eventually makes you unhappy."

#### Settling on a "How might we‚Ä¶" question

After ideating for many hours trying to come up with a good "How might we‚Ä¶" question we finally ended up with the following:

> How might we create an open conversation between adult Tallinners and their parents about mental health?

We felt that this really put all of the insight we got from the interviews and the research we did into perspective: not a lot of people feel comfortable about opening up. We wanted to fix that.

We then started ideating for solutions to answer that question.

#### Redesigning the question

Going through the process, we realised that it's not just about adults and Tallinners, but about everyone. This meant that we had to spend some more time thinking about the question. We then ended up with:

> How might we inspire different generations of Tallinners to exchange feelings and stories?

## Ideas

We had lots of different ideas, coming from our Lotus Blossoms and Crazy 8-s, but two of the ones that we tested were:

* a painting canvas, where you and the other person get a prompt and then you paint together, later talk about how you feel etc;
* a phone on the street, in the forest or where-ever, where you can vent your feelings ‚Äì this is also the one that we went with.

## Solution

The solution we came up with is called Ph√µ√µn. It consists of two words: phone and √µ√µs:√µ√µn (crevice in Estonian). The idea is simple: sometimes you may not want to burden your close or loved ones with the problems that you're having. You might even want to keep your problems secret. However, you may sometimes feel like talking to someone anonymously may be the solution ‚Äì hence the reason to create Ph√µ√µn: a phone on a tree in the forest, to which you can go to and vent.

## Results

We finished the project with an applause after showing everyone our final video. Sure, everyone received an applause, but we felt that ours was the best.
