## Introduction

Playser is a revolutionary musical device designed to change the way people explore their creativity through music. The device can connect to your computer via Bluetooth, allowing you to play 8 different notes based on MIDI outputs with a simple touch of its 8 built-in lasers. The product meets the needs of modern-day living by offering a compact and versatile way to explore your musical creativity. The team behind Playser comprised Sofia Kamergorodski, Valerio Bollea, and Kristjan Poska.

## The Creative Process & its Evolution

The team faced challenges brainstorming ideas that would fit the theme of "Smart Art" but ultimately stumbled upon the idea of incorporating lasers as cats love them. After giving the idea time to marinate, the team came up with the initial concept of Playser. The first prototype was designed to fit on a table and not feel like a toy. After some technical deliberation, the team settled for eight notes instead of twelve and a triangular shape.

## Skills, Technologies, and Integrating Them

The team began the building process with the guidance of their instructor, Anna, who provided them with essential electronics components and valuable advice during the initial lessons. They divided themselves into different tasks such as electronics, laser cutting, and designing. Through this process, they learned to design prototypes in Adobe Illustrator and laser cut them with precision, plan out each component of the electronics, and consider the final appearance of the product. Soldering was a time-consuming process that required meticulous attention to detail. Fortunately, the team successfully completed the prototype with no major setbacks.

## Inspired by AI

During the design process, AI provided the team with valuable creative insights. However, they discovered that when given prompts that require truly imaginative ideas - such as "imagine things that cannot be created for another hundred years" – ChatGPT falls somewhat short. While it offered them a plethora of ideas, they all seemed to fall into a similar category. AI image-generating tools (such as BlueWillow and Midjourney) had similar shortcomings – images usually ended up being too similar, and it was difficult to deviate from a certain style the AI was going for. While the concept images were visually beautiful, the team ultimately relied on their own creativity to design Playser.

## Conclusion

The Playser team's innovative approach to designing a musical device that's compact, versatile, visually appealing, and accessible to all demonstrates their commitment to creating products that meet the needs of modern-day living. Through their collaboration and dedication, the team successfully overcame challenges and built a prototype that inspires creativity and imagination.
